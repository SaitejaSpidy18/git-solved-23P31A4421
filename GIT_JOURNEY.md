## Conflicts Resolved

### Merge 1: main + dev (6 files)

#### Conflict 1: config/app-config.yaml
- **Issue**: Production used port 8080, development used 3000
- **Resolution**: Created unified config with environment-based settings
- **Strategy**: Keep production as default, add dev as optional
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 15 minutes

#### Conflict 2: config/database-config.json
- **Issue**: Different database hosts and SSL modes
- **Resolution**: Created separate profiles for production and development
- **Strategy**: Restructured JSON to support both environments
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 10 minutes

#### Conflict 3: scripts/deploy.sh
- **Issue**: Different deployment strategies (production vs docker-compose)
- **Resolution**: Added conditional logic based on DEPLOY_ENV variable
- **Strategy**: Made script handle both environments dynamically
- **Difficulty**: Hard
- **Time**: 20 minutes

#### Conflict 4: scripts/monitor.js
- **Issue**: Different monitoring intervals and log formats
- **Resolution**: Environment-based configuration object
- **Strategy**: Used process.env.NODE_ENV to determine behavior
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 15 minutes

#### Conflict 5: docs/architecture.md
- **Issue**: Different architectural descriptions
- **Resolution**: Merged both descriptions into comprehensive document
- **Strategy**: Created sections for each environment
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Time**: 10 minutes

#### Conflict 6: README.md
- **Issue**: Different feature lists and version numbers
- **Resolution**: Combined all features with clear environment labels
- **Strategy**: Organized features by category
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Time**: 10 minutes

### Merge 2: main + conflict-simulator (6 files)

#### Conflict 1: config/app-config.yaml
- **Issue**: Experimental feature flags introduced, conflicting with stable configuration.
- **Resolution**: Kept the stable production settings as primary; added experimental settings as commented-out entries or behind feature flags.
- **Strategy**: Ensured production config remains active, documented and isolated experimental code.
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 15 minutes

#### Conflict 2: config/database-config.json
- **Issue**: Experimental DB optimizations clashed with production-ready profiles.
- **Resolution**: Maintained existing production and development profiles; included experimental configuration details as separate, commented or flagged profiles.
- **Strategy**: Backward compatibility ensured; experimental DB options clearly marked as not production ready.
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 10 minutes

#### Conflict 3: scripts/deploy.sh
- **Issue**: New experimental deployment methods conflicted with stable deployment logic.
- **Resolution**: Kept primary script logic for stable deployment; wrapped experimental deployment features with a clearly marked "EXPERIMENTAL" section, using environment variables to toggle them.
- **Strategy**: Stable code is default, user can enable experimental logic by setting feature flags.
- **Difficulty**: Hard
- **Time**: 20 minutes

#### Conflict 4: scripts/monitor.js
- **Issue**: New experimental monitoring/reporting code conflicting with stable production monitoring.
- **Resolution**: Stable monitoring kept as default; included experimental monitoring functions, behind a feature flag using "process.env.EXPERIMENTAL_MONITORING".
- **Strategy**: Default to production, allow enabling experimental code for testing purposes; documented all changes.
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 15 minutes

#### Conflict 5: docs/architecture.md
- **Issue**: Experimental architecture changes described alongside production architecture.
- **Resolution**: Kept production architecture as the main document; included an "Experimental features" section, clearly labeled and marked as not ready for production.
- **Strategy**: Maintained clarity and backward compatibility; documented experimental ideas separately.
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Time**: 10 minutes

#### Conflict 6: README.md
- **Issue**: Feature lists and usage notes had both stable and experimental features intermingled.
- **Resolution**: Clearly separated stable (production-ready) and experimental features; documented experimental features as "beta/not for production".
- **Strategy**: Feature flags listed, instructions added on how to activate experimental options.
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Time**: 10 minutes

## Most Challenging Parts

1. **Understanding Conflict Markers**: Initially confused by `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` symbols. Learned that HEAD is current branch and the other side is incoming changes.

2. **Deciding What to Keep**: Hardest part was choosing between conflicting code. Learned to read both versions completely before deciding.

3. **Complex Logic Conflicts**: deploy.sh had completely different logic. Had to understand both approaches before combining.

4. **Testing After Resolution**: Making sure resolved code actually worked was crucial.

## Key Learnings

### Technical Skills
- Mastered conflict resolution process
- Understood merge conflict markers
- Learned to use git diff effectively
- Practiced all major Git commands

### Best Practices
- Always read both sides of conflict before resolving
- Test resolved code before committing
- Write detailed merge commit messages
- Use git status frequently
- Commit atomically

### Git Workflow Insights
- Conflicts are normal, not errors
- Take time to understand both changes
- When in doubt, ask for clarification
- Document your resolution strategy
- Keep calm and read carefully

## Reflection
This challenge taught me that merge conflicts aren't scary - they're 
just Git asking "which version do you want?". The key is understanding 
what each side is trying to do before combining them. I now feel 
confident handling conflicts in real projects.

The hands-on practice with all Git commands (especially rebase and 
cherry-pick) was invaluable. I understand the difference between merge 
and rebase, and when to use each. Most importantly, I learned that 
git reflog is a lifesaver!
